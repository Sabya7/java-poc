A Car Rental System is a software built to handle the renting of automobiles for a short period of time,
generally ranging from a few hours to a few weeks. A car rental system often has numerous local branches
(to allow its user to return a vehicle to a different location), and primarily located near airports or busy city areas.


We will focus on the following set of requirements while designing our Car Rental System:

The system will support the renting of different automobiles like cars, trucks, SUVs, vans, and motorcycles.

Each vehicle should be added with a unique barcode and other details, including a parking stall number which helps to locate the vehicle.

The system should be able to retrieve information like which member took a particular vehicle or what vehicles have been rented out by a specific member.

The system should collect a late-fee for vehicles returned after the due date.

Members should be able to search the vehicle inventory and reserve any available vehicle.

The system should be able to send notifications whenever the reservation is approaching the pick-up date, as well as when the vehicle is nearing the due date or has not been returned within the due date.

The system will be able to read barcodes from vehicles.

Members should be able to cancel their reservations.

The system should maintain a vehicle log to track all events related to the vehicles.

Members can add rental insurance to their reservation.

Members can rent additional equipment, like navigation, child seat, ski rack, etc.

Members can add additional services to their reservation, such as roadside assistance, additional driver, wifi, etc.
